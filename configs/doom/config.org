Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a

https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html, this is just a compilation
of different parts of his (and other's) configs, as well as a few parts I wrote
by my own. I'm slowly working on making my config "mine"

* Intro
[[xkcd:378]]

Customizing an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]]. The issue is

1. I use neovim (and neovide), not vim (and gvim)
2. Firenvim is only for browsers
3. Even if I found a neovim alternative, you can't do everything in neovim

I wanted everything, in one place. Hence why I (mostly) switched to Emacs.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+begin_quote
Redditor 1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool. \\
Redditor 2: Oh, there's an Emacs mode for that.
#+end_quote

This was enough for me to install Emacs, but there are
[[https://github.com/remacs/remacs#why-emacs][many other reasons]] to keep using it.

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.

With Org, I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and with the help
of others I've switched more and more to just using Emacs (just replace
"Linux" with "Emacs" in the comic below).

[[xkcd:456]]

Thats not to say using Emacs doesn't have its pitfalls. The performance leaves
something to be desired, but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Its
unrivaled in extensibility.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Radar chart comparing my thoughts on a few editors.
[[file:./misc/editor-comparison.jpeg]]
** Why Emacs?
Emacs is [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][not a text editor]], this is a common misnomer. It is far more apt to
describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text
manipulation environment/. That's quite a mouthful.
In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related
applications. It's a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is
generic.

Good with text. How far does that go? A lot further than one initially thinks:
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Task planning]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][File management]]
+ [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Terminal emulation]]
+ [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Email client]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Remote server tool]]
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Git frontend]]
+ Web [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][client]]/[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][server]]
+ and more...

Ideally, one may use Emacs as /the/ interface to perform =input → transform →
output= cycles, i.e. form a bridge between the human mind and information
manipulation.

*** The enveloping editor
Emacs allows one to do more in one place than any other application. Why is this
good?
+ Enables one to complete tasks with a consistent, standard set of keybindings,
  GUI and editing methods --- learn once, use everywhere
+ Reduced context-switching
+ Compressing the stages of a project --- a more centralised workflow can progress
  with greater ease
+ Integration between tasks previously relegated to different applications, but
  with a common subject --- e.g. linking to an email in a to-do list

Emacs can be thought of as a platform within which various elements of your
workflow may settle, with the potential for rich integrations between them --- a
/life/ IDE if you will.

Today, many aspects of daily computer usage are split between different
applications which act like islands, but this often doesn't mirror how we
/actually use/ our computers. Emacs, if one goes down the rabbit hole, can give
users the power to bridge this gap.

** Notes for the unwary adventurer
If you like the look of this, that's marvellous, and I'm really happy that I've
made something which you may find interesting, however:
#+begin_warning
This config is /insidious/. Copying the whole thing blindly can easily lead to
undesired effects. I recommend copying chunks instead.
#+end_warning

If you are so bold as to wish to steal bits of my config (or if I upgrade and
wonder why things aren't working), here's a list of sections which rely on
external setup (i.e. outside of this config).

Oh, did I mention that I started this config when I didn't know any =lisp=, and
this whole thing is a hack job? If you can suggest any improvements, please do
so, no matter how much criticism you include I'll appreciate it :)

*** Extra Requirements
The lovely ~doom doctor~ is good at diagnosing most missing things, but here are a
few extras.
+ A [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][LaTeX Compiler]] is required for the mathematics rendering performed in [[https://orgmode.org/][org]],
  and that wonderful pdf/html export we have going. I recommend [[https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic][Tectonic]].
+ I use the [[https://overpassfont.org/][Overpass]] font as a go-to sans serif.
  It's used as my ~doom-variable-pitch-font~
  I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
  desirable, namely:
  - A clean, and legible style. Highway-style fonts tend to be designed to be
    clear at a glance, and work well with a thicker weight, and this is inspired
    by /Highway Gothic/.
  - It's slightly quirky. Look at the diagonal cut on stems for example.
    Helvetica is a masterful design, but I like a bit more pizzazz now and then.
  - *Note:* Alegreya is used for my latex export and writeroom mode configurations
+ I use my [[https://github.com/shaunsingh/SFMono-Nerd-Font-Ligaturized][patched SFMono]] font as a go-to monospace.
 I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
 desirable, namely:
  - Elegent characters, and good ligatures/unicode support
  - It fits will with the rest of my system
+ A few LSP servers. Take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]]' to see which modules have the ~+lsp~
  flag.
+ Gnuplot, used for =org-plot=.
+ A build of emacs with modules and xwidgets support. I also recommend the
  native-comp flag with emacs28.

* Doom Configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).

**** Interface
There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

**** Org:
The majority of my work in emacs is done in org mode, even this configuration
was written in org! It makes sense that the majority of my packages are for
tweaking org then
#+name: org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-appear)

           :files ("*.el" "filters" "preprocessors")))
#+end_src

**** \LaTeX:
When I'm not working in org, I'm probably exporting it to latex. Lets adjust
that a bit too
#+name: latex
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-fragtog)

**** Web:
Sometimes I need to use markdown too. *Note:* emacs-webkit is temporarily disabled
because of its refusal to work without requiring org
#+name: web

#+end_src

**** Emacs Tweaks:
Emacs is missing just a few packages that I need to make it my OS. Specifically,
screenshot capabilities are nice, and using the same dictionaries accross
+operating systems+ bootloaders would be nice too!
#+name: emacs

**** Fun:
We do a little trolling
#+name: fun
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

* Basic Configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding
#+begin_src elisp
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

I want to run emacs28's new native-compiler with -O3, if available
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when 'native-comp-compiler-options
                 (setq native-comp-compiler-options '("-O3")))
#+end_src

** Personal information
Of course we need to tell emacs who I am
#+begin_src elisp
(setq user-full-name "Shaurya Singh"
      user-mail-address "shaunsingh0207@gmail.com")
#+end_src

** Authinfo
I frequently delete my =~/.emacs.d= for fun, so having authinfo in a seperate file
sounds like a good idea
#+begin_src elisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src

** Emacsclient
mu4e is a bit finicky with emacsclient, and org takes forever to load. The
solution? Use tecosaurs greedy daemon startup
#+begin_src elisp
(defun greedily-do-daemon-setup ()
  (require 'org)
  (require 'vertico)
  (require 'consult)
  (require 'marginalia)
  (when (require 'mu4e nil t)
    (setq mu4e-confirm-quit t)
    (setq +mu4e-lock-greedy t)
    (setq +mu4e-lock-relaxed t)
    (+mu4e-lock-add-watcher)
    (when (+mu4e-lock-available t)
      (mu4e~start))))

(when (daemonp)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'greedily-do-daemon-setup)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h))
#+end_src

** Shell
I use the fish shell. If you use zsh/bash, be sure to change this
#+begin_src elisp
(setq explicit-shell-file-name (executable-find "fish"))
#+end_src

*** Vterm
Vterm is my terminal emulator of choice. We can tell it to use ligatures, and also tell it to compile automatically
Vterm clearly wins the terminal war. Also doesn't need much configuration out of
the box, although the shell integration does. You can find that in =~/.config/fish/config.fish=
**** Always compile
Fixes a weird bug with native-comp
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq vterm-always-compile-module t)
#+end_src

**** Kill buffer
If the process exits, kill the =vterm= buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq vterm-kill-buffer-on-exit t)
#+end_src

**** Functions
Useful functions for the shell-side integration provided by vterm.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! vterm
  (setf (alist-get "magit-status" vterm-eval-cmds nil nil #'equal)
        '((lambda (path)
            (magit-status path)))))
#+end_src

I also want to hook Delta into Magit
#+begin_src elisp
(after! magit
   (magit-delta-mode +1))
#+end_src

**** Ligatures
Use ligatures from within vterm (and eshell), we do this by redefining the variable where /not/ to show ligatures
#+begin_src elisp
(setq +ligatures-in-modes t)
#+end_src

** Fonts
[[xkcd:590]]

I like the apple fonts for programming, so I'll go with Liga SFMono Nerd Font. I
prefer a rounder font for plain text, so I'll go with Overpass for that. I have a retina display as well, so lets keep the fonts light.
#+begin_src elisp
;;fonts
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Liga SFMono Nerd Font" :size 14)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Liga SFMono Nerd Font" :size 20)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 16)
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "Liga SFMono Nerd Font")
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "Liga SFMono Nerd Font" :weight 'light))
#+end_src

For mixed pitch, I would go with something comfier. I like Alegreya, so lets go with that
#+begin_src elisp
;;mixed pitch modes
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
(add-hook! 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode) ;enter mixed pitch mode in org mode

;;set mixed pitch font
 (after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 16))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Harfbuzz is missing the beautiful ff ffi ffj ffl fft fi fj ft Th ligatures,
lets add those back in with the help of composition-function-table
#+begin_src elisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
#+end_src

*** Font collections
Using the lovely conditional preamble, I'll define a number of font collections
that can be used for LaTeX exports. Who knows, maybe I'll use it with other
export formats too at some point.

To start with I'll create a default state variable and register =fontset= as part
of =#+options=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-latex
(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'alegreya
  "Fontset from `org-latex-fontsets' to use by default.
As cm (computer modern) is TeX's default, that causes nothing
to be added to the document.

If \"nil\" no custom fonts will ever be used.")
(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" org-latex-default-fontset)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex)))))
#+end_src

Then a function is needed to generate a LaTeX snippet which applies the fontset. It
would be nice if this could be done for individual styles and use different
styles as the main document font. If the individual typefaces for a fontset are
defined individually as
src_elisp{:serif}, src_elisp{:sans}, src_elisp{:mono}, and src_elisp{:maths}.
I can use those to generate LaTeX for subsets of the full fontset. Then, if I
don't let any fontset names have =-= in them, I can use =-sans= and =-mono= as
suffixes that specify the document font to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-latex
(defun org-latex-fontset-entry ()
  "Get the fontset spec of the current file.
Has format \"name\" or \"name-style\" where 'name' is one of
the cars in `org-latex-fontsets'."
  (let ((fontset-spec
         (symbol-name
          (or (car (delq nil
                         (mapcar
                          (lambda (opt-line)
                            (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex)
                                       :latex-font-set))
                          (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
              org-latex-default-fontset))))
    (cons (intern (car (split-string fontset-spec "-")))
          (when (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))
            (intern (concat ":" (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))))))))

(defun org-latex-fontset (&rest desired-styles)
  "Generate a LaTeX preamble snippet which applies the current fontset for DESIRED-STYLES."
  (let* ((fontset-spec (org-latex-fontset-entry))
         (fontset (alist-get (car fontset-spec) org-latex-fontsets)))
    (if fontset
        (concat
         (mapconcat
          (lambda (style)
            (when (plist-get fontset style)
              (concat (plist-get fontset style) "\n")))
          desired-styles
          "")
         (when (memq (cdr fontset-spec) desired-styles)
           (pcase (cdr fontset-spec)
             (:serif "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\rmdefault}\n")
             (:sans "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\sfdefault}\n")
             (:mono "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\ttdefault}\n"))))
      (error "Font-set %s is not provided in org-latex-fontsets" (car fontset-spec))))))
#+end_src

Now that all the functionality has been implemented, we should hook it into our
preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-latex
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '(org-latex-default-fontset . custom-font) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(custom-font :snippet (org-latex-fontset :serif :sans :mono) :order 0) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.custom-maths-font :eager t :when (custom-font maths) :snippet (org-latex-fontset :maths) :order 0.3) t))
#+end_src

Finally, we just need to add some fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-latex
(defvar org-latex-fontsets
  '((cm nil) ; computer modern
    (## nil) ; no font set
    (alegreya

#+end_src

When we're using Alegreya we can apply a lovely little tweak to =tabular= which
(locally) changes the figures used to lining fixed-width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-latex
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((string= (car (org-latex-fontset-entry)) "alegreya") . alegreya-typeface))

#+end_src

Due to the Alegreya's metrics, the =\LaTeX= symbol doesn't quite look right. We
can correct for this by redefining it with subtlety shifted kerning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Just in case the fonts aren't there, lets add check to notify the user of the

And with a little help from henrik, lets use those snippets in org mode

#+end_src

Source code blocks are a pain in org-mode, so lets make a few functions to help
with our snippets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers
                                  (intern (concat "org-babel-default-header-args:"
                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))
                  values))
    (let ((selection (consult--read question values :default default-value)))
      (unless (or (string-match-p "(default)$" selection)
                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-lang ()
  "Try to find the current language of the src/header at `point'.
Return nil otherwise."
  (let ((context (org-element-context)))
    (pcase (org-element-type context)
      ('src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('inline-src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('keyword (when (string-match "^header-args:\\([^ ]+\\)" (org-element-property :value context))
                  (match-string 1 (org-element-property :value context)))))))

(defun +yas/org-last-src-lang ()
  "Return the language of the last src-block, if it exists."
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (when (re-search-backward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
      (org-element-property :language (org-element-context)))))

(defun +yas/org-most-common-no-property-lang ()
  "Find the lang with the most source blocks that has no global header-args, else nil."
  (let (src-langs header-langs)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) src-langs))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) header-langs)))

    (setq src-langs
          (mapcar #'car
                  ;; sort alist by frequency (desc.)
                  (sort
                   ;; generate alist with form (value . frequency)
                   (cl-loop for (n . m) in (seq-group-by #'identity src-langs)
                            collect (cons n (length m)))
                   (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b))))))

    (car (cl-set-difference src-langs header-langs :test #'string=))))
#+end_src

Lets also include << to autocomplete, as with () and {}
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(sp-local-pair
 '(org-mode)
 "<<" ">>"
 :actions '(insert))
#+end_src

And lastly lets add some helpful snippets for org-mode, and add a better templete
#+begin_src elisp
(set-file-template! "\\.org$" :trigger "__" :mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src

** LSP
I think the LSP is a bit intrusive (especially with inline suggestions), so lets make it behave a bit more
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! lsp-ui
  :hook (lsp-mode . lsp-ui-mode)
  :config
  (setq lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil; not anymore useful than flycheck
        lsp-lens-enable t
        lsp-ui-doc-enable t
        lsp-tex-server 'digestif
        lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil
        lsp-ui-peek-enable t
        lsp-ui-peek-fontify 'on-demand
        lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil))
#+end_src

The rust language server also has some extra features I would like to enable
#+begin_src elisp
(after! lsp-rust
  (setq lsp-rust-server 'rust-analyzer
  lsp-rust-analyzer-display-chaining-hints t
  lsp-rust-analyzer-display-parameter-hints t
  lsp-rust-analyzer-server-display-inlay-hints t
  lsp-rust-analyzer-cargo-watch-command "clippy"
  rustic-format-on-save t))
#+end_src

** Better Defaults
The defaults for emacs aren't so good nowadays. Lets fix that up a bit
#+begin_src elisp
(setq undo-limit 80000000                          ;I mess up too much
      evil-want-fine-undo t                        ;By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      scroll-margin 2                              ;having a little margin is nice
      auto-save-default t                          ;I dont like to lose work
      display-line-numbers-type nil                ;I dislike line numbers
      history-length 25                            ;Slight speedup
      delete-by-moving-to-trash t                  ;delete to system trash instead
      browse-url-browser-function 'xwidget-webkit-browse-url
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…")                ;default ellipses suck

(fringe-mode 0) ;;disable fringe
(global-subword-mode 1) ;;navigate through Camel Case words
(tool-bar-mode 1) ;;re-enable the toolbar
#+end_src

There's issues with emacs flickering on mac (and sometimes wayland). This should
fix it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(inhibit-double-buffering . t))
#+end_src

Instead of fundamental mode, lisp-interaction-mode seems much more useful
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-scratch-initial-major-mode 'lisp-interaction-mode)
#+end_src

Ask where to open splits
#+begin_src elisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

...and open a buffer for it
#+begin_src elisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

The default bindings of doom are pretty good. I'm not so good with motions though, so lets make life easier with avy
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader
      :desc "hop to word" "w w" #'avy-goto-word-0)
(map! :leader
      :desc "hop to line"
      "l" #'avy-goto-line)
#+end_src

I also fine ; more intuitive than : for entering command mode
#+begin_src elisp
(after! evil
  (map! :nmv ";" #'evil-ex))
#+end_src

When im doing regexes, its usually with /g anyways, lets make that the default
#+begin_src elisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

Doom looks much cleaner with the dividers removed. Not sure why it isn't the default honestly
#+begin_src elisp
(custom-set-faces!
  `(vertical-border :background ,(doom-color 'bg) :foreground ,(doom-color 'bg)))

(when (boundp 'window-divider-mode)
  (setq window-divider-default-places nil
        window-divider-default-bottom-width 0
        window-divider-default-right-width 0)
  (window-divider-mode -1))
#+end_src

I don't like seeing the cursorline, especially while writing. Lets disable that
#+begin_src elisp
(remove-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook #'global-hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

Doom has a weird bug with emacs-plus where the cursor will just turn white on a light theme. Lets fix that.
#+begin_src elisp
(defadvice! fix-+evil-default-cursor-fn ()
  :override #'+evil-default-cursor-fn
  (evil-set-cursor-color (face-background 'cursor)))
(defadvice! fix-+evil-emacs-cursor-fn ()
  :override #'+evil-emacs-cursor-fn
  (evil-set-cursor-color (face-foreground 'warning)))
#+end_src

I like using the minimap, even if its slow. Looks cool in my opinion, lets make it a little cooler by removing the scroll highlighting
#+begin_src elisp
(setq minimap-highlight-line nil)
(custom-set-faces!
  `(minimap-active-region-background :background unspecified))
#+end_src

I like a bit of padding, both inside and outside, and lets make the line spacing comfier
#+begin_src elisp
;; Make a clean & minimalist frame
(use-package frame
  :config
  (setq-default default-frame-alist
                (append (list

** Selectric mode

#+begin_src elisp

#+end_src

* Visual configuration
** Modeline
Doom modeline already looks good, but it can be better. Lets add some icons, the battery status, and make sure we don't lose track of time
#+begin_src elisp
(after! doom-modeline
  (display-time-mode 1)                              ;Enable time in the mode-line
  (display-battery-mode 1)                           ;display the battery
  (setq doom-modeline-enable-word-count t))          ;Show word count
#+end_src

The encoding is always UTF-8, so its a bit redundant. Lets take that out
#+begin_src elisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding

                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))
(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding) ;;remove encoding
#+end_src

** Centaur tabs
There isn't much of a point having tabs when you only have one buffer open. This checks the number of tabs, and hides them if theres only one left
#+begin_src elisp
(defun centaur-tabs-get-total-tab-length ()

*** Fontifying inline src blocks
Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

Lets also add a function that makes it easy to convert from upper to lowercase,
since the ligatures don't work with Uppercase (I can make them work, but
lowercase looks better anyways)
#+begin_src elisp

        (unless (s-matches-p "RESULTS" (match-string 0))
          (replace-match (downcase (match-string 0)) t)
          (setq count (1+ count))))
      (message "Replaced %d occurances" count))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp

** Transparency
I'm not too big of a fan of transparency, but some people like it. You can use
this little function to toggle it now. On =C-c t= inactive windows will dim (85%
transparency)  and focused windows remain opaque
#+begin_src elisp

                     ;; Also handle undocumented (<active> <inactive>) form.
                     ((numberp (cadr alpha)) (cadr alpha)))
               100)
          '(100 . 85) '(100 . 100)))))
 (global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'toggle-transparency)

Make it easy to take nice screenshots. I need to figure out how to make
clipboard work though.

* Org
** Org-Mode
Org mode is the best writing format, no contest. The defaults are more
terminal-oriented, so lets make it look a little better

I like a little padding on my org blocks, just a millimeter or two on the top and bottom should do
#+begin_src elisp

Lets add org pretty table as well

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)
under this key will be shown and offered for selection.

* Latex
[[xkcd:1301]]
I have a love-hate relationship with latex. Its extremely powerful, but at the
same time its hard to write, hard to understand, and very slow. The solution:
write everything in org and then export it to tex. Best of both worlds!

** Basic configuration
First of all, lets use pdf-tools to preview pdfs by defaults
#+begin_src elisp
(setq +latex-viewers '(pdf-tools evince zathura okular skim sumatrapdf))
#+end_src

I also want to adjust the look of those previews
#+begin_src elisp
(after! org
  (setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
  (add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t))))

(after! org
  (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent"))
#+end_src

Lets add cdlatex org mode integration
#+begin_src elisp
(after! org
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex))

(defadvice! org-edit-latex-emv-after-insert ()
  :after #'org-cdlatex-environment-indent
  (org-edit-latex-environment))
#+end_src

I like to preview images inline too
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-display-inline-images t)
(setq org-redisplay-inline-images t)
(setq org-startup-with-inline-images "inlineimages")
#+end_src

Obviously we can't edit a png though. Let use org-fragtog to toggle between previews and text mode
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

Here's just my private LaTeX config.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-2.54cm}
\\setlength{\\evensidemargin}{\\oddsidemargin}
\\setlength{\\textheight}{\\paperheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headsep}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\footskip}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\topmargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-2.54cm}
")
#+end_src

** PDF-Tools
DocView gives me a headache, but pdf-tools can be improved, lets configure it a little more
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package pdf-view
  :hook (pdf-tools-enabled . pdf-view-themed-minor-mode)
  :hook (pdf-tools-enabled . hide-mode-line-mode)
  :config
  (setq pdf-view-resize-factor 1.1)
  (setq-default pdf-view-display-size 'fit-page))

*** Embed Externally Linked Images
I don't like to keep images downloaded to my laptop, it clutters up everything.
Org has a handy feature where you can pass a link instead, and org will display
it inline as usual.

HTML export handles this use case just fine, if the image isn't named then it
will display the image. However, latex doesn't have support for this. What we do
is instead of linking the image, we can have emacs download the linked image and
export that!

*** Embedded calc
Embedded calc is a lovely feature which let's us use calc to operate on LaTeX
maths expressions. The standard keybinding is a bit janky however (=C-x * e=), so
we'll add a localleader-based alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map calc-mode-map
      :after calc
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "E" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map latex-mode-map
      :after latex
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
#+end_src

Unfortunately this operates without the (rather informative) calculator and
trail buffers, but we can advice it that we would rather like those in a side
panel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar calc-embedded-trail-window nil)
(defvar calc-embedded-calculator-window nil)

    (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window nil))

** IRC
[[xkcd:1782]]

I'm trying to move everything to emacs, and discord is the one electron app I
need to ditch. With bitlbee and circe it should be possible

To make this easier, I

1. Have everything (serverinfo and passwords) in an authinfo.gpg file
2. Tell circe to use it
3. Use org syntax for formatting
4. Add emoji support
5. Set it up with discord

#+name: irc-authinfo-reader

(defun auth-server-pass (server)
  (if-let ((secret (plist-get (car (auth-source-search :host server)) :secret)))
      (if (functionp secret)
          (funcall secret) secret)
    (error "Could not fetch password for host %s" server)))

(defun register-irc-auths ()
  (require 'circe)
  (require 'dash)
  (let ((accounts (-filter (lambda (a) (string= "irc" (plist-get a :for)))
                           (auth-source-search :require '(:for) :max 10))))
    (appendq! circe-network-options
              (mapcar (lambda (entry)
                        (let* ((host (plist-get entry :host))
                               (label (or (plist-get entry :label) host))
                               (_ports (mapcar #'string-to-number
                                               (s-split "," (plist-get entry :port))))
                               (port (if (= 1 (length _ports)) (car _ports) _ports))
                               (user (plist-get entry :user))
                               (nick (or (plist-get entry :nick) user))
                               (channels (mapcar (lambda (c) (concat "#" c))
                                                 (s-split "," (plist-get entry :channels)))))
